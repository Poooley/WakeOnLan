# PowerOn

PowerOn is a tool that sends Wake-on-LAN (WoL) packets to devices on a network, allowing you to remotely power on devices with a supported network interface. It can be configured to send packets to devices on both Wide Area Networks (WAN) and Local Area Networks (LAN).

## Getting Started

To get started with PowerOn, follow these steps:

1. Use git clone
2. Navigate to the WakeOnLan directory and restore the dependencies by running the following command in the project directory:
```shell
cd WakeOnLan
dotnet restore
```

3. Build the project using the following command:
```shell
dotnet build -c Release
```
4. Create/Adjust the appsettings.json and executions.json files and modify the settings according to your preferences. These files should be placed in the same directory as the built executable. 

5. Navigate to the PowerOn directory and run the application using the following command:
```shell
cd PowerOn
dotnet run -c Release
```

## Configuration
To configure PowerOn, you need to create and modify two JSON files: appsettings.json and executions.json. These files should be placed in the same folder as the built executable.

### appsettings.json
This file contains general settings for PowerOn, such as retry attempts, retry delay, and local UDP port. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "PowerOn": {
    "RetryAttempts": 6,
    "RetryDelayMs": 300,
    "LocalUdpPort": 9
  }
}
```

* RetryAttempts: The number of times to retry sending a WoL packet if the initial attempt fails.
* RetryDelayMs: The delay in milliseconds between retries.
* LocalUdpPort: (ONLY LAN) The destination port to send the WoL packet to.

### executions.json
This file contains the device configurations for both WAN and LAN devices. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "WAN": [
    {
      "Domain": "example.com",
      "Port": 13234,
      "MacAddress": "XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"
    },
    {
      "Domain": "example.com",
      "Port": 13234,
      "MacAddress": "XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"
    }
  ],
  "LAN": [
    {
      "IpAddress": "192.168.178.02",
      "MacAddress": "XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"
    }
  ]
}
```
* WAN: An array of WAN device configurations, with each object containing the following properties:
  * Domain: The domain name or IP address of the device.
  * Port: The port to send the WoL packet to.
  * MacAddress: The MAC address of the device's network interface.
* LAN: An array of LAN device configurations, with each object containing the following properties:
  * IpAddress: The IP address of the device.
  * MacAddress: The MAC address of the device's network interface.
